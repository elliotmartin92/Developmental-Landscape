# ShinyExpressionMap

ShinyExpressionMap contains the codebase of Oo-site, the core product of the Developmental-Landscape project.

Developmental-Landscape is a project encapsulating Oo-site, a website allowing users to view matched mRNAseq and polysome-seq and integrates single-cell seq.
Oo-site

Oo-site provides several vizualiaztion options to view these data, including at the level of individual genes, GO-terms, or by using a user-supplied list of genes. Oo-site includes a reporting function to save any results the user wishes. The code for Oo-site can be found in the ShinyExpresionMap directory and the website can be viewed here.
Validation

The Developmental-Landscape repo also contains validation of these datasets in the form of a manuscript with various analyses performed using the underlying Oo-site code as well as supporting stainings. These data are compiled using code in the Paper directory and a compiled version of the current version of the text and figures can be found there as well.
