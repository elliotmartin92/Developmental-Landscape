# Developmental-Landscape

Developmental-Landscape is a project encapsulating Oo-site, a website allowing users to view matched mRNAseq and polysome-seq and integrates single-cell seq. 

## Oo-site
Oo-site provides several vizualiaztion options to view these data, including at the level of individual genes, GO-terms, or by using a user-supplied list of genes. 
Oo-site includes a reporting function to save any results the user wishes. The code for Oo-site can be found in the *ShinyExpresionMap* directory and the website can be viewed at 
https://elliotmartin (dot) shinyapps (dot) io/Oo-site/

## Validation
The Developmental-Landscape repo also contains validation of these datasets in the form of an (as yet unfinished) manuscript with various analyses performed using the underlying
Oo-site code as well as supporting stainings. These data are compiled using code in the *Paper* directory and a compiled version of the current version of the text and figures 
can be found there as well.
